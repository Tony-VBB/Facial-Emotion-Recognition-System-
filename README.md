# Facial-Emotion-Recognition-System-
Deep Learning, Computer Vision, PyTorch

– Designed an AI-driven system to classify human emotions from facial images.
– Implemented intelligent preprocessing pipelines including normalization, augmentation, resizing, and class balancing.
– Trained and tested deep learning models using structured experimentation and evaluation.
– Evaluated system performance using accuracy metrics, loss curves, and confusion matrix.
– Integrated the system into an application for real-time emotion detection.
